                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        This presentation describes sits, an open-source R package for satellite image time series analysis using machine learning. It supports the complete cycle of data analysis for land classification. Its API provides a simple but powerful set of functions. The software works in different cloud computing environments. Satellite image time series are input to machine learning classifiers, and the results are post-processed using spatial smoothing. Since machine learning methods need accurate training data, \sits includes methods for quality assessment of training samples. The software also provides methods for validation and accuracy measurement. The package thus comprises a production environment for big EO data analysis.

                    </h4> 
                    <p text-align="justify">
                        Epidemiology sits at an intersection of a number of different disciplines and uses techniques from, for example, the fields of health, medicine, statistics and geography.  Although the importance of the geographical component has historically been understood, interdisciplinary approaches to epidemiology and spatial analysis, where each discipline contributes and advances, are still a rarity. A number of geographical limitations impact epidemiological analysis, such as inconsistent geography, data scale/resolution, health and population data issues. In terms of epidemiological research, exposure misclassification, selection and ecological bias, rare diseases and confounding impact study design and methods. Combining the lessons learnt from both disciplines with advanced statistical approaches enables advances in both. In a world where epidemiology has gone from an almost unknown discipline to being a part of our everyday language and lives, due to COVID-19, this talk will explore the importance of the relationship between epidemiology and the geographical perspective.

                    <p text-align="justify">
                        Disease risk models are essential to inform public health and policy. These models can be used to quantify disease burden, understand geographic and temporal patterns, identify risk factors, and measure inequalities. In this workshop we will learn how to estimate disease risk and quantify risk factors using aerial and geostatistical data. We will also create interactive maps of disease risk and risk factors, and introduce presentation options such as interactive dashboards. We will work through two disease mapping examples using data of malaria in The Gambia and cancer in Pennsylvania, USA. We will cover the following topics:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Model disease risk in different settings</li>
                        <li>Manipulate and transform point, areal and raster data using spatial packages</li>
                        <li>Retrieve high resolution spatially referenced environmental data using the raster package</li>

                    <p>The workshop examples will focus on health applications, but the approaches covered are also applicable to other fields that use georeferenced data including ecology, demography or the environment.

                    <p text-align="justify">
                        In this workshop, we will cover how to access the air pollution data collected by the TROPOMI orbital sensor on Google Earth Engine, with an emphasis on nitrogen dioxide measurement, which has been used in many media examples as a proxy for mapping the intensity of activities during pandemic and lockdown periods. Nitrogen dioxide is strongly associated with urban activities and the burning of fossil fuels, such as diesel oil and also industrial activities, and analysing its temporal space distribution can give some interesting indications about human activities and their intensity on the Earth's surface.
