                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                         Our planet is in dire straits. Several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals address problems resulting from climate change and rising greenhouse gas emissions. The constant growth of urban mobility and transport has led to a dramatic increase in these emissions. In order to ensure livable environments for future generations, it will be necessary to reduce our CO2 footprint. Spatial decision-making fueled by spatial data science contributes to this effort in major ways, supported by recent progress regarding the availability of spatial big data, computational methods and geospatial technologies. This presentation will demonstrate why spatial decision-making is essential for sustainability and how spatial data science provides methods to perform large-scale spatio-temporal analyses of mobility patterns as well as geospatial technologies for changing people's mobility behavior. Examples will cover movement data analysis within the context of multi-modal and energy-efficient mobility, smart charging of electric vehicles, and mobile decision-making support.

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        This presentation describes sits, an open-source R package for satellite image time series analysis using machine learning. It supports the complete cycle of data analysis for land classification. Its API provides a simple but powerful set of functions. The software works in different cloud computing environments. Satellite image time series are input to machine learning classifiers, and the results are post-processed using spatial smoothing. Since machine learning methods need accurate training data, \sits includes methods for quality assessment of training samples. The software also provides methods for validation and accuracy measurement. The package thus comprises a production environment for big EO data analysis.

                    </h4> 
                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        In this workshop participants will learn about environmental citizen science using the modular sensor platform senseBox and the open citizen science data infrastructure openSenseMap. The senseBox is a DIY Citizen Science toolkit for local and mobile measurement of environmental data such as temperature, humidity, air pressure, illuminance, UV light or air quality. It can be connected to the internet via WiFi, Ethernet or LoRa to enable Internet of Things capabilities in a sensor network. 
                        Local workshop participants will build and code measurement devices on several environmental phenomena and collect data around the campus. Remote participants will learn to access and analyze data from the openSenseMap through its APIs and other external tools. At the end environmental geodata from the local experiment will be analyzed by the whole group.
                        We will round up with a discussion on the potential of the senseBox and openSenseMap in research projects and for educational purposes in secondary and higher education, while focusing on the data and computational, scientific and spatial literacy.

                    <p style="text-align:justify;">
                        In this workshop, we will cover how to access the air pollution data collected by the TROPOMI orbital sensor on Google Earth Engine, with an emphasis on nitrogen dioxide measurement, which has been used in many media examples as a proxy for mapping the intensity of activities during pandemic and lockdown periods. Nitrogen dioxide is strongly associated with urban activities and the burning of fossil fuels, such as diesel oil and also industrial activities, and analysing its temporal space distribution can give some interesting indications about human activities and their intensity on the Earth's surface.
